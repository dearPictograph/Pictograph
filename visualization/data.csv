1,P11,VR-D,32,Negative. Try the scribble but in three dimension a little too much of an X. too much like ion atom. I like that one. Same reason that last one.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1

There is no brown.trying to filling these. Looks kind of cool with the color mixing. Definitely hard to fill it in. I might just more loops.

1,P9,VR-D,39,I like the shapes way more in the box than they appear in the field. Just because it feels like when they are close to me they feel big and vibrant. It is challenge to make something look good in 3D when I don’t have practice with the pen. Especially compre with the shape I was looking before they all look for skeleton. Was going for mountain but look like jello to me.,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,1,
